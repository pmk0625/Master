# Getting Started with Create React App

# Creating an vent out website for CSUF Students 

This project was created for Project 1, CPSC 349, Front-end web design.

The authors of this website are:
Jason Zhu, Jacob Coyle, Ricardo Barojas, Minkyu Park

The purpose of this project is create a space where students can vent out anything they have on mind.
This is a free space where there exists no filter. Students have no limitation on what to vent out. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Credibility

We have used the guidance provided by a youtuber with channel name, Clever Programmer on building a facebook clone website.
We have added levels of details to fit our expectation required for CPSC-349.
