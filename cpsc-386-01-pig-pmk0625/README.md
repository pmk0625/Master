# The Pig game
## By Minkyu R. Park

The Pig game is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. The number to avoid is 1. Other than that, players take turn repeatedly rolling the dice and sum up the points to win. When number 1 cannot be avoided, there will be consequences.

## Rules
1. When playing by yourself, you will be against a computer. Playing 2 or more people, you will be against other players.
2. Players rolls dice taking turns.
3. Players may roll the dice multiple times during one turn. But when they roll a 1, their turn ends and they lose the points they earned throughout that turn.
4. Depending on the rolls, the number adds up. By stop rolling for that turn, the number becomes saved until the next turn. First player to get to the sum of 100 points wins.
